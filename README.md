- **TypeScript** for adding static typing to JavaScript, enhancing development experience
- **Vite** for fast development server and optimized builds
- **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management across the application
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests to backend services
- **Formik** for managing forms and validating input data
- **React Router DOM** for handling routing within the application
- **Bootstrap** for responsive design and layout
- **Framer Motion** for adding smooth animations and transitions
